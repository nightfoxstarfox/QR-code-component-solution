## My process

### Built with:
developed  with !HTML5 AND CSS3

### What I learned
I learned that for (centering) elements, you shouldn't rely on `margin` and `padding`. Instead, you should use:

```css
display: flex;
```

along with other properties to position content in the center of the screen, specifically:

```css
justify-content: center;
align-items: center;
```

After discovering the power of these properties, `margin` and `padding` became useless for centering elements.
